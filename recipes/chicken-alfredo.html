    <div class="steps">
        <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Cut each chicken breast in half lengthwise to create two cutlets, four total.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl combine 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and paprika. Evenly season both sides of the chicken with the spice mixture.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once the pan is hot, add the olive oil. Add the chicken and cook until the surface is browned, about 5 for 6 minutes. Flip and cook until the internal temperature reaches 160 to 165F (71 to 74C), about 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. Wash and dry the pan to use for making the alfredo sauce.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, bring 3 quarts of water to a boil. Add 1 1/2 teaspoon salt, stir to dissolve.</li>
            <li>Add the pasta and cook until al dente, about 10 to 12 minutes, or according to the manufacturer's directions. Use tongs to transfer to a colander - Reserve the starchy pasta water. While the pasta cooks, make the alfredo sauce.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add butter. Once melted, add garlic and saute until fragrant, 30 to 60 seconds. Do not brown the butter or garlic.</li>
            <li>Add the heavy cream, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, stir to combine. Bring the cream to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, frequently stirring, scraping the sides and bottom of the pan to make sure the cream does not curdle.</li>
            <li>Reduce the sauce to about 1 cup, 10 to 12 minutes. It should be slightly thickened and be able to coat the back of a spoon.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and stir in the parmesan cheese and nutmeg. If the sauce is too thick, add water or cream. Add 1 tablespoon at a time until you reach the desired consistency-season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        </ul>
